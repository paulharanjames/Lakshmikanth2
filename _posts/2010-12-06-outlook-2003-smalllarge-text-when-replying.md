It is such annoying..

Yesterday, accidently I changed text size when responding to email in Outlook 2003. Font size went really small and was very difficult to read/write the messages. Unfortunately, it is not easy to change it and with few help from Microsoft posts, finally got the solution and listed simple one below.

  * In Outlook 2003, Select File –> New –> Mail Message
  * Go to View –> Zoom 
  * Change percentage value to 100%

That’s it. you will back to Normal font size and your work can continue normally.
