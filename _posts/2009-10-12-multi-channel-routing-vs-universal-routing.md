**Multi-channel Routing** sends incoming contacts to unique queues for each channel. For example, there is a separate queue for phone contacts, a queue for e-mail contacts, and a queue for chat or web contacts.  
 **Problem**: With this approach the contact center agents & supervisors still need to investigate and manage the queues separately to deal with customer contacts coming through different channels.

**Universal Queuing** is a sophisticated mechanism that organizes all contacts, regardless of channel, into a single queue for consistent treatment of the customers. In other words, Universal Queuing enables contact centers to route and manage Phone calls, Faxes, E-mails and Web Interactions via a Single Queue.

Advantages of Universal Queuing

</p> 

  * Universal Queuing is the key to transform call centers into contact centers which ensures that the information about individual customers isn&#8217;t fragmented.
</ul> 



</p> 

  * Universal Queuing eliminates the need for contact centers to create a separate set of routing rules for each interaction type, thus reducing development and deployment time.
</ul> 



</p> 

  * Universal Queuing has the added advantage of enabling contact centers to perform end to- end reporting. By reporting on statistics across multiple interaction types, contact centers get a true view of customer behavior, which they can then use to identify ways of improving resource allocation.
