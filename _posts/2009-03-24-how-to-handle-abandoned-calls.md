Is your customer worried about increasing number of abandoned calls? No worry.. ðŸ™‚  
You can handle the abandoned calls very well in Genesys.  
All you need to do is pay me some 100,000 Â£ (lol)..

To handle abandoned calls you have to first **create a strategy** that would have the business logic as required to handle abandoned calls. For example, to add the callerâ€™s number to the callback list, or send a mail alert to the supervisor that your golden customer was left alone on the streets i.e., abandoned :). What next? Yes you have to execute this strategy in case of abandoned. For this use the function _**OnCallAbandoned[strategy name]**_ , which sets the strategy to be executed if EventAbandoned is received.. 

Now you will be happy with appreciation mails from customer..lol..

Cheers!!
