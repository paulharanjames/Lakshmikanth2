I always wanted to develop my own PDF reader so that I can organize all product manuals inside application, which will make it easy to browse/search with titles.

Well, I took first step towards this and developed PDF reader application, as below

I used open API’s to develop this with aim to develop web application like Google documents to read PDF files. I believe, it is good idea to store product documents in intranet and provide web access to it

In the coming weeks, I am planning to add functionality to organize documents. add search functionality and make it available as free download![Smile](http://lh6.ggpht.com/-3GBmdJhZ43k/UbifgjFXzQI/AAAAAAAAAEA/ALxkMsBpxyE/wlEmoticon-smile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800)
