When I was preparing design document using templates, I found that having line number was useful, especially for review.

Struggled a bit to set this using Office 2007, used Microsoft help to get these details…:-)

  1. On the **Page Layout** tab, in the **Page Setup** group, click **Line Numbers**. 
<img border="0" alt="Word Ribbon Image" src="http://office.microsoft.com/global/images/default.aspx?AssetID=ZA101539261033" /> 
    
     **Note**   If your document is divided into sections and you want to add line numbers to the entire document, you first need to select the document. Click **Select** in the **Editing** group on the **Home** tab, and then click **Select All**. Or press CTRL+A.

  2. Do one of the following: 
      * To number consecutively throughout the document, click **Continuous**. 
      * To start with number 1 on each page, click **Restart Each Page**. 
      * To start with number 1 after each section break, click **Restart Each Section**.

#### Remove line numbers

You can remove line numbers from the entire document, from a section, or from a paragraph.

  1. Click in the document, or click in the section or paragraph from which you want to remove line numbers. If you want to remove line numbers from multiple sections, select the sections. 
  2. On the **Page Layout** tab, in the **Page Setup** group, click **Line Numbers**. 
<img border="0" alt="Word Ribbon Image" src="http://office.microsoft.com/global/images/default.aspx?AssetID=ZA101539261033" /> 

  3. Do one of the following: 
      * To remove line numbers from the entire document or section, click **None**. 
      * To remove line numbers from a single paragraph, click **Suppress for Current Paragraph**.
