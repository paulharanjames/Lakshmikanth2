When you try to access the options like threshold wizard, action wizard template wizard etc.. on CCPlulse menu bar, it may be disabled or greyed out.  
How to fix this?  
This is due to lack of permission. To fix this, goto the person&#8217;s properties in CME which you use while logging in CCpulse. In the Ranks tab, click add and select CCpulse, with ranking for the person as administrator. Restart the CCpulse and now you should be happy seeing all the menu options back.. ðŸ™‚ 

Cheers!!
