What happens if the agent has personal callback in Campaign A and moved to campaign B‚Ä¶? Interesting question from the customer..

Tested and found that OCS fails with Agent Callback error in this scenario üôÅ What can we do now?

Fortunately, got workaround solution using treatments..

  * Configured treatment for Agent Callback error and assigned to Group

My customer is happy with this work around solution..if you have any other solution, let us know..
