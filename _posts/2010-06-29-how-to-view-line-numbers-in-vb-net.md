Remember line numbers ??? Long time ago, they were used to branch them with a ‘Go To’ statement. And it is still available with Visual Studio 2008 and pretty useful for error handling too…

For example, a lot of error messages give you specific line numbers in your code to use to find the errors. Trying to count down the page manually can be pretty tedious.

To enable line numbers, go to 

**Tools** menu item > **Options** > **Text Editor** > **Basic** > **General**

Click the checkbox in front of &#8220;Line Numbers&#8221;. It should do it…
