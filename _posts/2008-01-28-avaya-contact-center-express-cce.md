Avaya Contact Center Express is a Microsoft Windows-based software suite that enables companies to turn one-dimension call centers into multi-media contact centers. Using the phantom call capability supported by Avaya DEFINITY, Multivantage or Communications Manager switches, Contact Center Express 3.0 allows end customers to contact the company via phone, email, text or instant messaging. Whether your customers like texting on their mobile phones, sending emails or chatting over the internet, their preferred method of communicating will be treated exactly the same as a traditional phone call. It will be placed in a priority queue and distributed to an agent with relevant skills and knowledge. Whatâ€™s more, the agent can reply using the same method of contact, conducting a helpful conversation, just like you would expect over the phone.

Easy to implement and simple to use, Contact Center Express also delivers:
