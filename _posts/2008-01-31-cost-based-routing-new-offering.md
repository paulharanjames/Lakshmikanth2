Cost based routing.. Good concept !! If implemented correctly, it can be boom for many call centers / organizations.Â 

What is cost based routing solution?

Cost based routing is new offering from Genesys 7.5 version onwards. In this scenarios,Â routing decisions are based on totalÂ routing cost of an interaction. It calcualtes intrastructure cost and resource cost (of course, we need to defineÂ these in config manager) beforeÂ  routing an interaction.

Very interestingÂ !! You will find more information about this on &#8220;Routing solutions guide&#8221; from Genesys.Â 

I am planning to implement the same in my lab environment and will post more information ðŸ™‚
