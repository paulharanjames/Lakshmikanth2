      Uninstalling applications in mac is very different than windows. Although, in most cases, simply deleting application to trash, it may leave preferences and application files &#8211; depending on your application, it may be few KB to GB size, you may want to completely remove application and all associated files.</span></div> 
      
      <div>
        <span><br /></span>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <span>To manually remove an application and all associated files:</span>
      </div>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>Launch Activity Monitor and change &#8220;My Processes&#8221; at the top to &#8220;All Processes&#8221;, then make sure the app you want to remove is not running. If it is, quit the process before proceeding.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Launch Finder and search for the app name (hopefully unique, such as Skype)</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>You can narrow the search to specific folders or search your whole Mac</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Searching &#8220;File Name&#8221; vs &#8220;Contents&#8221; usually provides better results.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Click the + button below the search term to add criteria</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Click the search criteria drop-down and select &#8220;Other&#8230;&#8221;, then &#8220;System files&#8221;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Click the &#8220;don&#8217;t include&#8221; and change to &#8220;include&#8221;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Sort by name, kind, date, etc. to identify components of the app, such as folders, .plist files, cache files. etc.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Delete all files and folders related to the app.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Don&#8217;t empty your Trash until you&#8217;ve determined that everything is working OK, in case you need to restore something you deleted by accident.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>A reboot might be necessary to completely remove some apps.</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
