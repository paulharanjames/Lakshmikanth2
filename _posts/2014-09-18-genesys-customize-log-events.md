Do you know that¬†log events can be customized from version 7.6 in Genesys? Wait, what is this &#8216;log event customization&#8217;?

Simple.¬†Genesys allows you to define log level for each log message and you can customize it per application.

Oh &#8230; but why do I need to customize log events?

To explain this, I will start with real case scenario. Recently, I got an assignment to review Genesys solution¬†as they were getting default routed calls during busy period and implement/recommend methods¬†to improve solution performance.

After identifying and solving configuration, routing strategy, reporting and staffing allocation¬†issues, they were still getting default routed calls. At this point, this is as much as you can do within Genesys standard tools. Next,¬†I developed tool to find &#8216;default routed calls&#8217; for analysis (<a title="Tool to find default routed calls" href="http://www.lakshmikanth.com/tool-to-find-default-routed-calls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>) , which helped me to identify call patterns and fix issues -both technical and process.

For obvious reasons, customer like to use this tool functionality &#8211; ¬†to identify default routed calls and don&#8217;t need other features like reporting & logging etc. I can develop server application (good for me) but it is overweight solution for this requirement and want to keep it simple.

Analyzing URS logs and log messages, I found that I can configure alarm condition for log message &#8217;15-20003&#8242; which will help to store Conn ID and timestamp for further analysis. Exactly what I want !!

<div id="attachment_4061" style="width: 1212px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://localhost/newlakshmikanth3/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/URSDefaultRouting1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4061" class="wp-image-4061 size-full" src="http://localhost/newlakshmikanth3/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/URSDefaultRouting1.png" alt="URS Log Message" width="1202" height="343" srcset="http://localhost/newlakshmikanth3/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/URSDefaultRouting1.png 1202w, http://localhost/newlakshmikanth3/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/URSDefaultRouting1-300x86.png 300w, http://localhost/newlakshmikanth3/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/URSDefaultRouting1-1024x292.png 1024w, http://localhost/newlakshmikanth3/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/URSDefaultRouting1-768x219.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1202px) 100vw, 1202px" /></a>
  
  <p id="caption-attachment-4061" class="wp-caption-text">
    URS Log Message
  </p>
</div>

But I dont want to recommend interaction level logging information to be stored in log database for this piece of information. I want¬†to improve overall solution performance¬†and interaction level logging to log database will increase network traffic üôÅ

This is an ideal scenario to use &#8216;log event customization&#8217; feature from Genesys. From 7.6 version onwards, we¬†can customize this log event i.e) change level from **&#8216;INTERACTION&#8217;** to &#8216;**STANDARD&#8217;** and configured¬†**&#8216;STANDARD&#8217;** level logging to &#8216;network&#8217;.

Even though, 20003 log level message is &#8216;INTERACTION&#8217; level logging, it will be reassigned dynamically and sent to Message server to store it in log database. For customer notification, I configured alarm condition for this log event and send email notification <a title="Genesys CCPulse ‚Äì How to send email notification?" href="http://www.lakshmikanth.com/ccpulse-send-email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(How to send email notification?</a>)
