  <p>
    I listed important ICON alarms below to be configured in every environment to reduce data loss for reporting application
  </p>

Interaction Concentrator will try to resubmit failed transactions until SQL Server returns a positive response. </p>

              ICON cannot preserve or store the data: [errtxt] <br />[errtxt]<br />Specific details regarding the error <br />Interaction Concentrator cannot preserve or store the data. There are many events that could cause ICON to generate this error, including operating systems errors, disk full, insufficient memory, system queue corruption, or internal software errors. Manual intervention is required <br /><strong>Recommended Actions:</strong></p> 
              
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Check for and correct any operating system errors.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Check that your disk is not full.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If either step does not resolve the problem, contact Genesys Technical Support for investigation of possible internal error

              Persistent storage backlog threshold reached: [<strong>errtxt</strong>] <br />[<strong>errtxt</strong>]<br />Specific details regarding the backlog <br />Using the pq-backlog-alarm-threshold configuration option, you have defined a threshold that ICON is to observe when it is unable to write records to IDB. If this event appears, this limit has been reached and ICON can no longer backlog records to memory. <br />It is common for ICON to log this event following 09-25024 <br /><strong>Recommended Actions:</strong><br /> One of the configured backlog thresholds of persistent storage has been reached. </p> 
              
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Check that threshold parameter is properly set.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Check the ICON and related T-Server logs for errors.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Correct any problems that you discover.

                The amount of time it takes to clear the backlog depends on how much data from the abnormal condition must be flushed. <br />Cancel Event is <strong>09-25026</strong>
