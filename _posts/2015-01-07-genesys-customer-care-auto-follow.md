Recently, Genesys re-designed their auto follow-up process for customer care tickets. As per new process, follow-up process is triggeredÂ wheneverÂ Genesys proposes a solution or requests information for an open case as below

  * First follow-up &#8211; After 2 business days without response
  * Second follow-up &#8211; After 5 business days without response
  * After 10 business days, ticket will be closed and notification sent to user.

In many cases, even though I provided response to Genesys & waiting for feedback, I still got auto follow-up messages and tickets were getting closed. As an user, it was frustrating experience and raised itÂ with Genesys about this process

Now I received clarification on how this process works and thought will share it with you

  * We need to provide response by using web interface only. Unlike old ticketing system, replying to emails doesn&#8217;t change ticket status
  * I used to update ticket by using â€˜Post Updateâ€™ button. Genesys confirmed that it doesn&#8217;t change ticket status and we should use â€˜Provide responseâ€™ button from top of the page. Screenshots below for reference.

My opinion &#8211; and I shared it with Genesys &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t help end user/customer. As such, Genesys environment is complex to understand for any new comerÂ and always encourage support engineers to use phone conversation to seek clarifications. Auto follow-up process should be triggered only when the solution is provided & agreed by customer or when support engineer enables it.

Hope Genesys will improve process to help customers ðŸ™‚
