Record History logging provides you with additional reporting options for

calling lists. This logging process does not use database access to write logs;

instead it uses flat (text) files that the customer defines. You can turn enable this logging for selective calling lists.

**How to configure Record history logging:**

  * In CME, select the calling list 
  * Go to Annex Tab and create section **â€˜defaultâ€™**, if not available already 
  * Create option **â€˜dial\_log\_destinationâ€™** with value as **â€˜Folder Pathâ€™** to store record history log files 
  * Create Option **â€˜dial\_log\_delimiterâ€™** with value as **â€˜,â€™** to create comma separated delimiter between the fields 

By default, it attaches the below mentioned mandatory fields

  * record_id 
  * contact_info 
  * contact\_info\_type 
  * record_type 
  * record_status 
  * call_result 
  * attempt 
  * dial\_sched\_time 
  * call_time 
  * daily_from 
  * daiy_till 
  * tz_dbid 
  * agent_id 
  * chain_id 
  * chain_n 

If you want to attach user-defined fields in the record history logging, please follow the steps below

  * In CME, select the field . 
  * Go to Annex Tab and create section â€˜defaultâ€™, if not available already. 
  * Create Option â€˜send_attributeâ€™ with value as field name. 

Record History log will then have the value with key as field name and value.. ðŸ™‚ 

I am playing with Genesys 8.0 and planned to cover the details in the coming weeks.. keep watching this space..
